# Search Testing Sub-Feature

## Overview
This sub-feature provides a testing interface for customers to validate their documentation search functionality, including hybrid search capabilities and metadata filtering.

## Sub-Feature Scope
- Search testing panel with namespace selection
- Configurable search parameters (hybrid search, top-K results)
- Results display with chunk content and source document links
- Optional metadata filtering capabilities (low priority)

## Key Components
- **Search Interface**: Namespace picker + query input + search configuration
- **Results Display**: Retrieved chunks with scores and source document references
- **Search Configuration**: Hybrid search toggle, top-K selection
- **Metadata Filters**: Optional filtering by document metadata (future enhancement)

## Parent Feature Relationship
This is part of the larger Documentation Retrieval UI feature and enables:
- Customers to validate their documentation ingestion quality
- Testing search functionality before deploying to MCP servers
- Understanding search result quality and relevance

## Related Sub-Features
- **Namespace Management**: Provides list of available namespaces for testing
- **Document Views**: Links to full document content from search results
- **Job Monitoring**: Ensures documents are ingested before testing

## Technical Notes
- Uses existing Turbopuffer search infrastructure (already implemented)
- Debounced search queries for performance
- No usage data collection (testing interface remains private)
- Integration with existing search backend from retrieval package

## Implementation Priority
**Medium Priority** - Valuable for customer validation but not critical for core functionality.
