[Introductory paragraph stating the business reason - what and why - a user would want to do this procedure.]

**Prerequisites**

Complete the following items before you perform this task:
* First item
* Second item

To [do this task]: [For example, "To create a customer license:"]

1. Log in to the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), and click **Customer > Create Customer**.

   [Optional: Include a results step. Use only when a result is not obvious, such as in a complex UX flow like GitOps. For example, "A list of your applications displays and shows the status of GitOps integration for each application."]

1. Edit the fields:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Name</th>
      <th width="70%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Field Name</td>
      <td>Example description: The type of customer is used solely for reporting purposes. Their access to your app is not affected by the type you assign to them. <strong>Options:</strong> Development, Trial, Paid, Community. <strong>Default:</strong> Trial. For more information, see <a href="releases-creating-customer">Creating a Customer</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <!--If you need a resizable screenshot, and give the user the ability to display a larger size image if needed, format it like this:
    
   <img alt="channel settings dialog" src="/images/channel-settings.png" width="500px"/>

   [View a larger version of this image](/images/channel-settings.png)>

  -->

1. Run the following command to export the blah blah blah:

  ```
  kubectl kots pull UPSTREAM_URI --cluster CLUSTER_NAME
  ```

  Replace:

  - UPSTREAM_URI: With the URI for the application.
  - CLUSTER_NAME: With the name of the kubeconfig cluster.


  [Use a bulleted list for the placeholder text definitions unless you feel the list is too long and that a table would be cleaner. If you need to use a table, use the following table format:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Replace</th>
      <th width="70%">With</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>UPSTREAM_URI</td>
      <td>The URI for the application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CLUSTER_NAME</td>
      <td>The name of the kubeconfig cluster.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

1. Click **Save Changes**.
