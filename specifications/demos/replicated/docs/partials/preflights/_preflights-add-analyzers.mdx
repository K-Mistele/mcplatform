You must add analyzers to analyze the data from the collectors that you specified. Define the criteria for the pass, fail, and warn outcomes, and specify custom messages for each. 

For example, you can set a `fail` outcome if the MySQL version is less than the minimum required. Then, specify a message to display that informs your customer of the reasons for the failure and steps they can take to fix the issue.
