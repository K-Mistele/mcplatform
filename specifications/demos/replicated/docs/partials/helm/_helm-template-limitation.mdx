Helm's `lookup` function and some values in the built-in `Capabilities` object are not supported with the `kots.io/v1beta1` HelmChart custom resource.

   This is because KOTS uses the `helm template` command to render chart templates locally. During rendering, Helm does not have access to the cluster where the chart will be installed. For more information, see [Kubernetes and Chart Functions](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#kubernetes-and-chart-functions) in the Helm documentation.
