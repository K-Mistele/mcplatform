You cannot migrate existing Helm charts in existing installations from the `useHelmInstall: false` installation method to a different method. If KOTS already installed the Helm chart previously in the environment using a HelmChart custom resource with `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1` and `useHelmInstall: false`, then KOTS does not attempt to install the chart using a different method and displays the following error message: `Deployment method for chart <chart_name> has changed`.

To change the installation method from `useHelmInstall: false` to a different method, the user must reinstall your application in a new environment.
