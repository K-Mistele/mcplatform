The `values` key can be used to set or delete existing values in the Helm chart `values.yaml` file. Any values that you include in the `values` key must match values in the Helm chart `values.yaml`. For example, `spec.values.images.pullSecret` in the HelmChart custom resource matches `images.pullSecret` in the Helm chart `values.yaml`.

During installation or upgrade with KOTS, `values` is merged with the Helm chart `values.yaml` in the chart archive. Only include values in the `values` key that you want to set or delete.
