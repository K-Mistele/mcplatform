To deploy Helm charts, KOTS requires a unique HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart `.tgz` archive in the release. You configure the HelmChart custom resource to provide the necessary instructions to KOTS for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. Additionally, the HelmChart custom resource creates a mapping between KOTS and your Helm chart to allow Helm values to be dynamically set during installation or upgrade.
