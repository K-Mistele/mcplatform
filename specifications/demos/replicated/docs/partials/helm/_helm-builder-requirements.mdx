The `builder` key has the following requirements and recommendations:
* Replicated recommends that you include only the minimum Helm values in the `builder` key that are required to template the Helm chart with the correct image tags.
* Use only static, or _hardcoded_, values in the `builder` key. You cannot use template functions in the `builder` key because values in the `builder` key are not rendered in a customer environment.
* Any `required` Helm values that need to be set to render the chart templates must have a value supplied in the `builder` key. For more information about the Helm `required` function, see [Using the 'required' function](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#using-the-required-function) in the Helm documentation.
