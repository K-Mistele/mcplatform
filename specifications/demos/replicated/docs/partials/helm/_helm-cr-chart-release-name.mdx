Specifies the release name to use when installing this instance of the Helm chart. Defaults to the chart name.

The release name must be unique across all charts deployed in the namespace. To deploy multiple instances of the same Helm chart in a release, you must add an additional HelmChart custom resource with a unique release name for each instance of the Helm chart.

Must be a valid Helm release name that matches regex `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$` and is no longer than 53 characters.
