KOTS template functions are based on the Go text/template library. All functionality of the Go templating language, including if statements, loops, and variables, is supported with KOTS template functions. For more information, see [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) in the Go documentation. 

Additionally, KOTS template functions can be used with all functions in the Sprig library. Sprig provides several template functions for the Go templating language, such as type conversion, string, and integer math functions. For more information, see [Sprig Function Documentation](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).
