Common use cases for KOTS template functions include rendering values during installation or upgrade, such as:
* Customer-specific license field values
* User-provided configuration values
* Information about the customer environment, such the number of nodes or the Kubernetes version in the cluster where the application is installed
* Random strings

KOTS template functions can also be used to work with integer, boolean, float, and string values, such as doing mathematical operations, trimming leading and trailing spaces, or converting string values to integers or booleans.
