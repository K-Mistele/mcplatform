* The version label for the release must match the version label from one of the `Chart.yaml` files in the release.
* If there is one Helm chart in the release, Replicated automatically uses the version from the `Chart.yaml` file.
* If there is more than one Helm chart in the release, Replicated uses the version label from one of the `Chart.yaml` files. You can edit the version label for the release to use the version label from a different `Chart.yaml` file.
