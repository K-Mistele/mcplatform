When a release is required, KOTS requires users to upgrade to that version before they can upgrade to a later version. For example, if you select **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** for release v2.0.0, users with v1.0.0 deployed must upgrade to v2.0.0 before they can upgrade to a version later than v2.0.0, such as v2.1.0.
