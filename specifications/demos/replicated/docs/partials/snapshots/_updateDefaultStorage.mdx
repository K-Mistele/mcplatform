If Velero is already installed, you can update your storage destination in the Replicated Admin Console. 

For embedded clusters with the Velero add-on, you must update the default internal storage settings in the Admin Console because internal storage is insufficient for full backups. 

For more information about updating storage, see [Updating Settings in the Admin Console](snapshots-updating-with-admin-console).
