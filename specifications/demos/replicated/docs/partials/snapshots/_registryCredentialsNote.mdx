:::note
It is typical for the velero and node-agent (restic) Pods to be in the `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff` state after you run the `velero install` command because Velero does not support passing registry credentials during installation. In Replicated KOTS v1.94.0 and later, this situation resolves itself after you complete the instructions to configure the storage destination.

If you are on an earlier version of KOTS, Replicated recommends that you upgrade to KOTS v1.94.0 or later. Otherwise, you must patch the Velero deployment manually and add the image pull secret to access the registry.
