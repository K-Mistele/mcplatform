_Embedded Kubernetes_ refers to delivering a Kubernetes distribution alongside an application, so that both Kubernetes and the application are deployed in the customer environment. Embedding Kubernetes allows software vendors to install their Kubernetes application in non-Kubernetes customer-controlled environments, such as virtual machines (VMs) or bare metal servers. Additionally, software vendors that embed Kubernetes with their application have greater control over the charactersitics of the cluster where their application is installed. This allows vendors to deliver a cluster that meets their application's requirements, which can help reduce errors during installation.
