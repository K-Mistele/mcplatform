If a team member adds a GitHub username to their Vendor Portal account that already exists in the collab repository, then the Vendor Portal does _not_ change the role that the existing user is assigned in the collab repository.

However, if the RBAC policy assigned to this member in the Vendor Portal later changes, or if the member is removed from the Vendor Portal team, then the Vendor Portal updates or removes the user in the collab repository accordingly.
