The replicated-collab organization in GitHub is used for tracking and collaborating on escalations, bug reports, and feature requests that are sent by members of a Vendor Portal team to the Replicated team. Replicated creates a unique repository in the replicated-collab organization for each Vendor Portal team. Members of a Vendor Portal team submit issues to their unique collab repository on the Support page in the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/support).

For more information about the collab repositories and how they are used, see [Replicated Support Paths and Processes](https://community.replicated.com/t/replicated-vendor-support-paths-and-processes/850) in _Replicated Community_.
