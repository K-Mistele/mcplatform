1. SSH onto a controller node in the cluster and download the air gap bundle for the new version using the same curl command that you used to install. For example:

   ```bash
    curl -f https://replicated.app/embedded/APP_SLUG/CHANNEL_SLUG?airgap=true -H "Authorization: LICENSE_ID" -o APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
   ```

   For more information, see [Install](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap#install).

1. Untar the tarball. For example:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
   ```
   Ensure that the `.airgap` air gap bundle is present.

1. Use the `update` command to upload the air gap bundle and make this new version available in the Admin Console. For example:

    ```bash
    ./APP_SLUG update --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap
    ```

1. When the air gap bundle has been uploaded, open a browser on the same machine and go to the Admin Console.
