Replicated Embedded Cluster allows you to distribute a Kubernetes cluster and your application together as a single appliance, making it easy for enterprise users to install, update, and manage the application and the cluster in tandem. Embedded Cluster is based on the open source Kubernetes distribution k0s. For more information, see the [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/).

For software vendors, Embedded Cluster provides a Config for defining characteristics of the cluster that will be created in the customer environment. Additionally, each version of Embedded Cluster includes a specific version of Replicated KOTS, ensuring compatibility between KOTS and the cluster. For enterprise users, cluster updates are done automatically at the same time as application updates, allowing users to more easily keep the cluster up-to-date without needing to use kubectl.
