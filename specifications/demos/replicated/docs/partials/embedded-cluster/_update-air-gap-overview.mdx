To upgrade an installation, new air gap bundles can be uploaded to the Admin Console from the browser or with the Embedded Cluster binary from the command line.

Using the binary is faster and allows the user to download the air gap bundle directly to the machine where the Embedded Cluster is running. Using the browser is slower because the user must download the air gap bundle to a machine with a browser, then upload that bundle to the Admin Console, and then the Admin Console can process it.
