1. On a machine with browser access (for example, where you accessed the Admin Console to configure the application), download the air gap bundle for the new version using the same curl command that you used to install. For example:

   ```bash
    curl -f https://replicated.app/embedded/APP_SLUG/CHANNEL_SLUG?airgap=true -H "Authorization: LICENSE_ID" -o APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
   ```
   For more information, see [Install](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap#install).

1. Untar the tarball. For example:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
   ```
   Ensure that the `.airgap` air gap bundle is present.
