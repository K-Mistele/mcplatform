To provision a cluster on a VM or bare metal server, kURL uses a spec that is defined in a manifest file with `apiVersion: cluster.kurl.sh/v1beta1` and `kind: Installer`. This spec (called a _kURL installer_) lists the kURL add-ons that will be included in the cluster. kURL provides add-ons for networking, storage, ingress, and more. kURL also provides a KOTS add-on, which installs KOTS in the cluster and deploys the KOTS Admin Console. You can customize the kURL installer according to your application requirements.
