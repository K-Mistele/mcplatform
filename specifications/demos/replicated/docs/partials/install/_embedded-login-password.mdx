After the installation command finishes, note the `Kotsadm` and `Login with password (will not be shown again)` fields in the output of the command. You use these to log in to the Admin Console.

  The following shows an example of the `Kotsadm` and `Login with password (will not be shown again)` fields in the output of the installation command:

  ```
          Installation
            Complete âœ”

  Kotsadm: http://10.128.0.35:8800
  Login with password (will not be shown again): 3Hy8WYYid

  This password has been set for you by default. It is recommended that you change
  this password; this can be done with the following command:
  kubectl kots reset-password default
  ```
