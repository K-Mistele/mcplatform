* Ensure that your cluster meets the minimum system requirements. See [Minimum System Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#minimum-system-requirements) in _Installation Requirements_.

* Ensure that you have at least the minimum RBAC permissions in the cluster required to install KOTS. See [RBAC Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#rbac-requirements) in _Installation Requirements_.

  :::note
  If you manually created RBAC resources for KOTS as described in [Namespace-scoped RBAC Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#namespace-scoped), include both the `--ensure-rbac=false` and `--skip-rbac-check` flags when you run the `kots install` command.
  
  These flags prevent KOTS from checking for or attempting to create a Role with `* * *` permissions in the namespace. For more information about these flags, see [install](/reference/kots-cli-install) or [admin-console upgrade](/reference/kots-cli-admin-console-upgrade).
  :::

* Review the options available with the `kots install` command before installing. The `kots install` command includes several optional flags to support different installation use cases. For a list of options, see [install](/reference/kots-cli-install) in the _KOTS CLI_ documentation.
