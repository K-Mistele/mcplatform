* `REGISTRY_HOST` with the same hostname for the private registry where you pushed the Admin Console images.

* `RO_USERNAME` and `RO_PASSWORD` with the username and password for an account that has read-only access to the private registry.
    
    :::note
    KOTS stores these read-only credentials in a Kubernetes secret in the same namespace where the Admin Console is installed.

    KOTS uses these credentials to pull the images. To allow KOTS to pull images, the credentials are automatically created as an imagePullSecret on all of the Admin Console Pods.
