A load balancer is required for high availability mode. If your vendor has chosen to use the internal load balancer with the kURL EKCO add-on, you do not need to provide your own external load balancer. An external load balancer can be preferred when clients outside the cluster need access to the cluster's Kubernetes API.

If you decide to use an external load balancer, the external load balancer must be a TCP forwarding load balancer. For more information, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

The health check for an apiserver is a TCP check on the port that the kube-apiserver listens on. The default value is `:6443`. For more information about the kube-apiserver external load balancer, see [Create load balancer for kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/#create-load-balancer-for-kube-apiserver) in the Kubernetes documentation.
