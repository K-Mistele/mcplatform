Extract the KOTS Admin Console container images from the `kotsadm.tar.gz` bundle and push the images to your private registry:

    ```
    kubectl kots admin-console push-images ./kotsadm.tar.gz REGISTRY_HOST \
      --registry-username RW_USERNAME \
      --registry-password RW_PASSWORD
    ```

    Replace:

    * `REGISTRY_HOST` with the hostname for the private registry. For example, `private.registry.host` or `my-registry.example.com/my-namespace`.
    
    * `RW_USERNAME` and `RW_PASSWORD` with the username and password for an account that has read and write access to the private registry.
