For KOTS installations, you can generate a support bundle using the default KOTS spec. This is useful if the application does not have a support bundle spec included.

#### Online Environments

In an online environment, run the following command to generate a support bundle using the default KOTS spec:

```
kubectl support-bundle https://kots.io
```

#### Air Gap Environments

For air gap environments, perform the following steps to generate a support bundle using the default KOTS spec:

1. Run the following command from a computer with internet access to download the default KOTS spec:
 
   ```
   curl -o spec.yaml https://kots.io -H 'User-agent:Replicated_Troubleshoot/v1beta1'
   ```

1. Upload the `spec.yaml` file to your air gap server.

1. Run the following command to create a support bundle using the uploaded `spec.yaml` file:

    ```
