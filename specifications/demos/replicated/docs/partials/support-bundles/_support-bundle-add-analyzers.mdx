Add analyzers based on conditions that you expect for your application. For example, you might require that a cluster have at least 2 CPUs and 4GB memory available.

  Good analyzers clearly identify failure modes. For example, if you can identify a log message from your database component that indicates a problem, you should write an analyzer that checks for that log.

  At a minimum, include application log analyzers. A simple text analyzer can detect specific log lines and inform an end user of remediation steps.

  Analyzers that Replicated recommends considering are:

- **Resource statuses:** Check the status of various resources, such as Deployments, StatefulSets, Jobs, and so on.
- **Regular expressions:** Analyze arbitrary data.
- **Databases:** Check the version and connection status.
