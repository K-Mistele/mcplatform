To generate a kURL host support bundle:

1. Do one of the following:

    - Save the host support bundle YAML file on the host. For more information about creating a YAML spec for a host support bundle, see [Create a Host Support Bundle Spec](/vendor/support-host-support-bundles#create-a-host-support-bundle-spec).

    - Run the following command to download the default kURL host support bundle YAML file from the Troubleshoot repository:

      ```
      kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/host/default.yaml
      ```

   :::note
   For air gap environments, download the YAML file and copy it to the air gap machine.
   :::

1. Run the following command on the host to generate a support bundle:

   ```
   ./support-bundle --interactive=false PATH/FILE.yaml
   ```

   Replace:
     - `PATH` with the path to the host support bundle YAML file.
     - `FILE` with the name of the host support bundle YAML file from your vendor.

   :::note
   Root access is typically not required to run the host collectors and analyzers. However, depending on what is being collected, you might need to run the support-bundle binary with elevated permissions. For example, if you run the `filesystemPerformance` host collector against `/var/lib/etcd` and the user running the binary does not have permissions on this directory, the collection process fails.
   :::  

1. Share the host support bundle with your vendor's support team, if needed.

1. Repeat these steps for each node because there is no method to generate host support bundles on remote hosts. If you have a multi-node kURL cluster, you must run the support-bundle binary on each node to generate a host support bundle for each node.
