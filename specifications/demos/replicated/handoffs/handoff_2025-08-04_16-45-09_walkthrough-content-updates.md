# Handoff: Replicated Quickstart Walkthrough Content Updates

## Task(s)
1. **Update walkthrough workflow** (completed) - Modified the first step to reflect that users work on their local machine throughout the walkthrough, not on the Linux VM
2. **Add environment variable persistence** (completed) - Updated step 3 to save the REPLICATED_APP environment variable to `.env.replicated` file
3. **Inline YAML content** (completed) - Added complete YAML file contents to steps that create configuration files
4. **Import updated walkthrough** (completed) - Successfully imported the updated walkthrough into the database

## Recent changes
1. **specifications/demos/replicated/replicated-quickstart-walkthrough-import.json**:
   - Step 0: Updated to create a VM requirements verification script instead of running commands directly
   - Step 2: Added instructions to append REPLICATED_APP to `.env.replicated` file
   - Step 4: Inlined complete YAML content for all manifest files (gitea.yaml, kots-app.yaml, k8s-app.yaml, embedded-cluster.yaml)
   - Step 10: Added complete preflight YAML content for gitea-preflights.yaml
   - Fixed embedded-cluster.yaml version to use 2.6.0+k8s-1.30

2. **Database changes**:
   - Deleted old walkthrough (wt_VqrAi3pnGi8lQYXX3dVfF)
   - Imported updated walkthrough (new ID: wt_gw6JrtdVzy3lfSvbdtRVT)

3. **Removed file**:
   - Deleted specifications/demos/replicated/replicated-quickstart-walkthrough.json (simpler format) to maintain single source of truth

## Learnings
1. **Walkthrough structure**: The import format requires specific fields like version, exportedAt, walkthrough wrapper, and nextStepReference
2. **Environment variables**: Agents often have permission issues with `.env` files, so using `.env.replicated` is safer
3. **YAML content**: All file content must be inlined in the operationsForAgent field - agents cannot infer what to write without explicit content
4. **SST shell requirement**: Import scripts require SST environment to be active - use `bun sst shell -- bun scripts/...`
5. **Port configuration**: Gitea runs on service port 3000 internally but is exposed on NodePort 32000 for external access

## Artifacts
- specifications/demos/replicated/replicated-quickstart-walkthrough-import.json (updated walkthrough file)
- specifications/demos/replicated/handoffs/handoff_2025-08-04_16-45-09_walkthrough-content-updates.md (this handoff)
- Deleted: specifications/demos/replicated/replicated-quickstart-walkthrough.json

## Action Items & Next Steps
1. **Verify walkthrough association**: Check if the new walkthrough (wt_gw6JrtdVzy3lfSvbdtRVT) needs to be associated with any MCP servers
2. **Test the walkthrough**: Run through the updated walkthrough to ensure all steps work correctly with the new content
3. **Monitor for issues**: Watch for any user feedback about the updated workflow, especially the VM script creation approach
4. **Consider future improvements**:
   - Add more detailed error handling instructions for common issues
   - Consider adding a step to source the `.env.replicated` file in future sessions
   - Think about adding validation steps after file creation

## Other Notes
- The walkthrough tools are located in scripts/walkthrough-tools/
- The source MDX document is at specifications/demos/replicated/quick-start-merged.mdx
- Organization ID for this walkthrough: 1HBRrQgQ2oBucPpcNY8K08T0QC2QTW5F
- The VM requirements script includes comprehensive checks with color-coded output and detailed failure messages
- All YAML files now include proper syntax highlighting (```yaml) for better readability
