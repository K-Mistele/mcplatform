# Requirements for Walkthrough Authoring & Management UI

## Goal
Create a comprehensive dashboard interface that allows MCPlatform customers to create, edit, and manage interactive walkthroughs through a dedicated full-page editing environment. This system enables customers to author structured content using a four-field approach (introduction for agent, context for agent, content for user, operations for agent) with real-time preview capabilities and sophisticated step management.

## Important Context
Note: all paths provided in this document are relative to `packages/dashboard`, the dashboard package in this monorepo.
Exceptions: 
* All database-related paths such as `schema.ts`, `auth-schema.ts` and `mcp-auth-schema.ts` are under `packages/database/src`, and are exported under `packages/database/index.ts`
* Any paths beginning with `specification/` are at the top level of the repository and NOT under `packages/`; the `specification/` directory is at the SAME LEVEL as the `packages/` directory.

### Current Implementation
The database schema is already implemented in `packages/database/src/schema.ts` with:
- `walkthroughs` table for walkthrough metadata
- `walkthroughSteps` table with JSONB `contentFields` using versioned structure
- `walkthroughStepContentField` Zod schema defining the four-field content structure
- Support for walkthrough types: course, installer, troubleshooting, integration, quickstart
- Linked-list structure for step ordering via `nextStepId` and `displayOrder`

### Composition Pattern
Standard MCPlatform pattern with async server components for data fetching, client components for interactivity, and promises passed between them using React 19 `use()` hook with proper Suspense and ErrorBoundary wrapping.

### Data Model
The structured content model uses versioned JSONB with four distinct fields:
- `introductionForAgent`: Optional context about step objectives
- `contextForAgent`: Optional background information and search terms
- `contentForUser`: Required markdown content presented to users
- `operationsForAgent`: Optional specific actions for AI agents to perform

These fields will be used to render nunjucks XML+markdown templates through MCP tool calls at a later date. 
## User Stories

### Walkthrough Management & Creation
1. **Given** I am a MCPlatform customer, **when** I navigate to the dashboard, **then** I should see a "Walkthroughs" sidebar item **so that** I can access walkthrough management in a dedicated section separate from MCP servers.

2. **Given** I want to create a new walkthrough, **when** I click "Create Walkthrough", **then** I should be able to enter title, description, and select from five walkthrough types (üìö Course, ‚öôÔ∏è Installer, üîß Troubleshooting, üîó Integration, ‚ö° Quick Start) with descriptions and field requirements **so that** I can establish the basic structure and appropriate AI template behavior for my content.

3. **Given** I have multiple walkthroughs, **when** I access the walkthroughs page, **then** I should see a comprehensive data table with search, filter, and sorting capabilities **so that** I can efficiently manage and organize my content.

### Content Authoring & Editing  
4. **Given** I need to edit walkthrough content, **when** I select a walkthrough to edit, **then** I should access a full-page three-panel editor (navigator, content editor, preview) **so that** I have dedicated space for complex content creation without modal limitations.

5. **Given** I am authoring step content, **when** I edit a step, **then** I should work with four distinct structured fields (introduction for agent, context for agent, content for user, operations for agent) with type-aware validation based on my selected walkthrough type **so that** I can create AI-optimized instructional content with clear separation of concerns.

6. **Given** I am creating content, **when** I make changes in the editor, **then** I should see real-time preview showing both structured field view and final Nunjucks template output **so that** I can validate my content before publishing.

### Step Management & Organization
7. **Given** I need to manage walkthrough steps, **when** I use the steps navigator, **then** I should be able to add, edit, delete, and reorder steps with visual indicators for content completion **so that** I can build comprehensive walkthroughs and optimize learning flow.

8. **Given** I want to test my walkthrough, **when** I use the preview functionality, **then** I should see a full simulation that mimics the actual MCP tool experience with template compilation validation **so that** I can identify and fix issues before users encounter them.

### Publishing & State Management
9. **Given** I am working on walkthrough content, **when** I make changes, **then** I should have a save button that is always visible with text showing time since last save and maintain draft/published status control **so that** I can control when my content is saved and can manage publication workflow effectively.
