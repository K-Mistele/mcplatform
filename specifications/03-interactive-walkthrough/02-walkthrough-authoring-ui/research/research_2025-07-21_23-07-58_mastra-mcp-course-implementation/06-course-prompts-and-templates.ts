# Welcome to the Mastra Course!

Thank you for registering for the Mastra course! This interactive guide will help you learn how to build powerful AI agents with Mastra, the open-source AI Agent framework built in TypeScript.

## Before We Begin

If you enjoy Mastra, please consider starring the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra

This helps the project grow and reach more developers like you!

## How This Course Works

- Each lesson is broken into multiple steps
- I'll guide you through the code examples and explanations
- You can ask questions at any time
- If you ever leave and come back, use the \`startMastraCourse\` tool to pick up where you left off. Just ask to "start the Mastra course".
- Use the \`nextMastraCourseStep\` tool to move to the next step when you're ready. Just ask to "move to the next step" when you are ready.
- Use the \`getMastraCourseStatus\` tool to check your progress. You can just ask "get my course progress".
- Use the \`clearMastraCourseHistory\` tool to reset your progress and start over. You can just ask "clear my course progress".

Type "start mastra course" and let's get started with your first lesson!

// CRITICAL: Lesson prompt wrapper - applied to ALL course content
export const lessonPrompt = `
  This is a course to help a new user learn about Mastra, the open-source AI Agent framework built in Typescript.
  Please help the user through the steps of the course by walking them through the content and following the course
  to write the initial version of the code for them. The goal is to show them how the code works and explain it as they go
  as the course goes on. Each lesson is broken up into steps. You should return the content of the step and ask the user
  to move to the next step when they are ready. If the step contains instructions to write code, you should write the code
  for the user when possible. You should always briefly explain the step before writing the code. Please ensure to 
  return any text in markdown blockquotes exactly as written in your response. When the user ask about their course progress or course status,
  make sure to include the course status url in your response. This is important.
