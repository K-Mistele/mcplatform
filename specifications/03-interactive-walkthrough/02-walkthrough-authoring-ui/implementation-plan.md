# Walkthrough Authoring & Management UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation creates a comprehensive dashboard interface that allows MCPlatform customers to create, edit, and manage interactive walkthroughs through a dedicated full-page editing environment. The system enables customers to author structured content using a four-field approach with real-time preview capabilities and sophisticated step management.

## Implementation Status

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All phases implemented successfully  
**Completion Date**: July 29, 2025  
**Total Development Time**: ~1 day  
**Validation Date**: July 29, 2025  
**Validation Report**: [validation-findings.md](./validation-findings.md)

### What Was Delivered

1. **✅ Complete Walkthrough Authoring UI** - Full three-panel editor with navigator, content editor, and preview
2. **✅ CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete walkthroughs and steps with proper validation
3. **✅ Structured Content System** - Four-field editing system with type-based requirements
4. **✅ Local Draft Recovery** - Auto-save to localStorage with restore/discard functionality
5. **✅ Template Engine** - Nunjucks-based rendering for AI agent consumption
6. **✅ Publishing Workflow** - Draft/published status control with immediate publishing option
7. **✅ Management Interface** - Data table with search, filtering, and type organization
8. **✅ Navigation Integration** - Sidebar navigation item and proper routing

### Key Features Implemented

- **Multi-field Content Editor**: Introduction for Agent, Context for Agent, Content for User, Operations for Agent
- **Real-time Preview**: Both structured view and final AI template output
- **Step Management**: Create, edit, reorder steps with completion indicators
- **Type-based Validation**: Different field requirements based on walkthrough type
- **Auto-save & Recovery**: Local draft storage with session recovery prompts
- **Template Rendering**: Nunjucks engine for consistent AI agent content formatting
- **Publishing Controls**: Draft/published status with immediate availability to end users

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists Now
- **Complete database schema** with structured content support in `packages/database/src/schema.ts:212-240`
- **Fully functional MCP tools** for end-user walkthrough consumption in `packages/dashboard/src/lib/mcp/tools/walkthrough.ts`
- **Robust progress tracking utilities** in `packages/dashboard/src/lib/mcp/walkthrough-utils.ts`
- **Versioned JSONB content structure** supporting four distinct fields: `introductionForAgent`, `contextForAgent`, `contentForUser`, `operationsForAgent`

### What's Missing
- Dashboard navigation item for "Walkthroughs"
- Management pages for CRUD operations on walkthroughs  
- oRPC actions for walkthrough authoring (no walkthrough actions exist in `packages/dashboard/src/lib/orpc/actions.ts`)
- Full-page editor with three-panel layout (navigator, editor, preview)
- Structured content editing interface for the four-field system

### Key Discoveries
- **Database schema** supports versioned JSONB with four distinct fields (`packages/database/src/schema.ts:6-27`)
- **oRPC pattern** uses `.actionable({})` for server actions with proper organization scoping (`packages/dashboard/src/lib/orpc/actions.ts:21-37`)
- **Navigation structure** follows established pattern in `packages/dashboard/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx:31-72`
- **Three-panel layouts** exist using responsive grid patterns in existing detail pages
- **TanStack Table** is used extensively for data management interfaces (`packages/dashboard/src/components/mcp-servers-table.tsx:173-363`)

### Critical Issue Identified
- **Schema mismatch**: Utility functions in `packages/dashboard/src/lib/mcp/walkthrough-utils.ts` reference deprecated `instructions` field instead of new `contentFields` structure
- **No migration needed**: No walkthroughs have been created yet, so we can update utilities without data migration

## What We're NOT Doing

- Auto-save functionality to server (manual save only, but local draft recovery)
- Advanced collaborative editing features (last save wins)
- Rich text editing beyond basic markdown for user content
- Character limit enforcement or markdown/template validation (just text)
- List virtualization for steps navigator (using TanStack Virtual)
- Analytics integration (future enhancement)
- Walkthrough versioning beyond draft/published status
- Mobile responsive design optimization (desktop-first approach)
- Permission system beyond organization membership
- Edit locking or conflict resolution (last save wins)

## Implementation Approach

Multi-phase implementation focusing on core authoring experience first, then enhancing with preview capabilities. The approach follows MCPlatform's established patterns with Server Components for data fetching, oRPC actions for mutations, and three-panel layout using responsive grid systems.

   - Test form submission

3. **Template Engine** (`packages/dashboard/tests/walkthrough-authoring/template.test.ts`)
   - Test Nunjucks rendering with various inputs
   - Test edge cases (empty fields, special characters)

### Integration Tests
1. **End-to-End Flows** (`packages/dashboard/tests/walkthrough-authoring/e2e.test.ts`)
   - Create walkthrough → Add steps → Edit content → Save
   - Navigation between steps
   - Draft recovery flow

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. Create walkthrough of each type
2. Add multiple steps
3. Test local draft recovery
4. Verify template preview
5. Test keyboard shortcuts
6. Verify last-save-wins behavior
