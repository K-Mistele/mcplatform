# Handoff: Walkthrough Step Completions Analytics Table

## Task(s)

1. **Analyze step reordering resilience** - Status: Completed
   - Created comprehensive analysis document of current next-step calculation algorithm
   - Determined system is already resilient to reordering and addition
   - Identified minor issues with deletion (orphaned IDs) and major restructuring

2. **Design and implement `walkthroughStepCompletions` table** - Status: Completed
   - Added new table to track individual step completion timestamps
   - Designed optimized indexing strategy based on codebase analysis
   - Implemented fields for comprehensive analytics and sankey diagram support

3. **Research and optimize database indexing** - Status: Completed
   - Analyzed existing query patterns in codebase (especially `tool_calls` table)
   - Reduced initial 7 indexes to 5 optimized indexes based on actual usage
   - Ensured support for all three primary query needs

## Recent changes

### Database Schema (`packages/database/src/schema.ts`)
- **Added `walkthroughStepCompletions` table** (lines 289-327):
  - Primary key: `id` with prefix `wtsc_`
  - Foreign keys: `mcpServerUserId`, `walkthroughId`, `stepId`, `mcpServerId`, `mcpServerSessionId`
  - Timestamp: `completedAt` (bigint)
  - Metadata: `metadata` (JSONB)
  
- **Implemented optimized indexing strategy**:
  - `wtsc_server_time_idx`: Organization-wide time series analytics
  - `wtsc_walkthrough_step_time_idx`: Sankey diagram generation
  - `wtsc_user_walkthrough_idx`: User progress queries
  - `wtsc_session_idx`: Session replay functionality
  - `wtsc_server_walkthrough_idx`: Organization-wide walkthrough analytics
  - `wtsc_user_step_unique`: Data integrity constraint

- **Added TypeScript type export** (line 344):
  - `export type WalkthroughStepCompletion = typeof walkthroughStepCompletions.$inferSelect`

## Learnings

1. **Current progress tracking is resilient**:
   - The ID-based approach with `display_order` handles reordering perfectly
   - `calculateNextStep` in `packages/dashboard/src/lib/mcp/walkthrough-utils.ts:64-100` uses a solid algorithm
   - Main limitation is major restructuring scenarios

2. **Analytics query patterns in MCPlatform**:
   - Organization filtering happens via JOIN to `mcp_servers` table
   - Time-based queries always have additional filters (never just ORDER BY time)
   - Session-based queries are common and deserve dedicated indexes
   - Composite indexes are preferred over many single-column indexes

3. **Existing unused field discovered**:
   - `current_step_id` exists in `walkthrough_progress` table but is not used
   - This field is ready for the automatic step advancement implementation

4. **Index optimization insights**:
   - Analyzed `tool_calls` table queries to understand patterns
   - Most queries filter by organization via server JOIN + time range
   - Individual column indexes often redundant when covered by composites

## Artifacts

- `/Users/kyle/Documents/Projects/mcplatform/specifications/03-interactive-walkthrough/01-core-infrastructure-mcp-tools/thoughts/step-reordering-resilience-analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis of current system resilience
- `/Users/kyle/Documents/Projects/mcplatform/packages/database/src/schema.ts:289-344` - New table definition and indexes
- `/Users/kyle/Documents/Projects/mcplatform/specifications/03-interactive-walkthrough/handoffs/handoff-1.md` - Updated with focus on automatic advancement and analytics

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Run database migration**:
   - User needs to run migration commands to create the new `walkthroughStepCompletions` table
   - Table is ready with optimized indexes for all query patterns

2. **Implement step completion tracking**:
   - Update `completeStep` function in `walkthrough-utils.ts` to insert records into new table
   - Include session ID and server ID in completion records
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing progress tracking

3. **Implement automatic step advancement** (per handoff-1.md):
   - Utilize the existing but unused `current_step_id` field
   - Update `start_walkthrough` to set initial step
   - Modify `get_next_step` to remove `current_step_id` parameter requirement

4. **Build analytics queries**:
   - Session replay: Query by `mcpServerSessionId` 
   - Sankey diagrams: Use `walkthroughId` + `stepId` + time ordering
   - Organization analytics: Leverage `mcpServerId` + `walkthroughId` composite

5. **Update tests**:
   - Fix broken test imports that expect old handler functions
   - Add tests for step completion tracking
   - Test analytics query performance

## Other Notes

### Query patterns the new table supports:
- **Session replay**: `WHERE mcp_server_session_id = ? ORDER BY completed_at`
- **Sankey diagram**: `WHERE walkthrough_id = ? GROUP BY step_id, previous_step`
- **Organization analytics**: `JOIN mcp_servers WHERE organization_id = ? GROUP BY walkthrough_id`

### Important files for next steps:
- `packages/dashboard/src/lib/mcp/walkthrough-utils.ts` - Add completion tracking to `completeStep` function
- `packages/dashboard/src/lib/mcp/tools/walkthrough.ts` - Update tools to track completions
- `packages/dashboard/src/lib/orpc/router.ts` - Pattern for analytics query implementation

### Design decisions:
- Chose bigint timestamps over PostgreSQL timestamp type for consistency
- Used JSONB metadata field for extensibility
- Kept table focused on completions only (not attempts or views)
- Indexed for read-heavy analytics workload rather than write optimization
