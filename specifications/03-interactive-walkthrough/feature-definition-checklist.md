## Implementation Notes

### Sub-feature 01: Core Infrastructure & MCP Tools ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status**: Fully implemented and validated (2025-07-22)
- **Database**: 4 new tables with sophisticated progress tracking algorithm
- **MCP Tools**: 5 tools with Zod validation, analytics tracking, and conditional registration
- **Testing**: 38 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate
- **Next**: Database migration required before sub-feature 02 can begin

### Sub-feature 04: Documentation Retrieval
- **Status**: Requirements defined (2025-07-30)
- **Purpose**: Enable AI agents to search customer documentation via MCP tool
- **Key Components**: Namespace management, GitHub ingestion, Turbo Puffer search
- **Dependencies**: Requires stable walkthrough step IDs for analytics correlation

### Sub-feature 05: Walkthrough Analytics & Insights
- **Status**: Requirements enhanced with documentation search integration (2025-07-30)
- **Enhancements**: Sankey diagrams, search correlation, unified journey analytics
- **Dependencies**: Requires documentation retrieval for full analytics capabilities

### Remaining Sub-features
Sub-features 02-05 depend on the database schema from sub-feature 01. Once migrations are applied, development can proceed on the dashboard UI components, documentation retrieval, and enhanced analytics features.
