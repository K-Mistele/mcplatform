## Implementation Notes

### Sub-feature 01: Core Infrastructure & MCP Tools ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status**: Fully implemented and validated (2025-07-22)
- **Database**: 4 new tables with sophisticated progress tracking algorithm
- **MCP Tools**: 5 tools with Zod validation, analytics tracking, and conditional registration
- **Testing**: 38 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate
- **Next**: Database migration required before sub-feature 02 can begin

### Remaining Sub-features
Sub-features 02-04 depend on the database schema from sub-feature 01. Once migrations are applied, development can proceed on the dashboard UI components and analytics features.
