# Documentation Retrieval Package - Summary

## Overview

The retrieval package is a comprehensive document ingestion and search system that powers MCPlatform's documentation retrieval feature. It enables customers to provide their documentation to AI coding assistants through MCP servers.

## Documentation Structure

This directory contains detailed documentation about the retrieval package:

1. **[feature.md](./feature.md)** - Original feature specification outlining business requirements and user stories

2. **[retrieval-package-analysis.md](./retrieval-package-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of the retrieval package architecture, components, and implementation

3. **[implementation-guide.md](./implementation-guide.md)** - Technical implementation details, code patterns, and deployment considerations

4. **[workflow-diagram.md](./workflow-diagram.md)** - Visual representations of system architecture, data flows, and processing pipelines using Mermaid diagrams

5. **[troubleshooting-guide.md](./troubleshooting-guide.md)** - Operational guide for diagnosing and resolving common issues

## Key Components

### Core Technologies
- **Inngest**: Durable workflow orchestration
- **Turbopuffer**: Hybrid vector and keyword search
- **Google AI (Gemini)**: Document contextualization and embeddings
- **AWS S3**: Document storage
- **Redis**: Caching layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata storage

### Processing Pipeline
1. Document upload to S3
2. Chunking into processable segments
3. AI-powered contextualization
4. Embedding generation
5. Vector storage in Turbopuffer
6. Searchable through MCP tools

### Key Features
- Multi-tenant architecture with strict data isolation
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
- Intelligent document chunking preserving structure
- Rate-limited API usage with batching
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Performance optimized with caching and parallel processing

## Implementation Status

Based on code analysis:
- ✅ Core ingestion pipeline implemented
- ✅ Markdown document support
- ✅ Embedding and search functionality
- ✅ Multi-tenancy and security
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ⏳ Image processing (stubbed)
- ⏳ PDF support (detected but not processed)
- ⏳ Document versioning
- ⏳ Search analytics

## Testing

The package includes extensive tests covering:
- Input validation
- Inngest function workflows
- Caching behavior
- Document processing
- Error scenarios
- Integration flows

Tests are located in `packages/retrieval/test/04-documentation-retrieval/`

## Quick Reference

### Environment Variables
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY          # Gemini AI API key
TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY     # Vector search API key
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY       # Workflow authentication
INNGEST_BASE_URL        # Inngest server URL
INNGEST_DEV             # Development mode flag
```

### Key Database Tables
- `retrieval_namespace` - Document collections
- `retrieval_documents` - Document metadata
- `retrieval_chunks` - Searchable content pieces
- `retrieval_ingestion_job` - Processing status

### API Rate Limits
- Chat API: 1,000 requests/minute
- Embedding API: 3,000 requests/minute
- Batch size: 100 chunks
- Gather period: 5 seconds

## Next Steps

For implementation:
1. Review the feature specification for business requirements
2. Study the implementation guide for technical details
3. Use workflow diagrams to understand data flows
4. Reference troubleshooting guide for operations

For development:
1. Complete image processing implementation
2. Add PDF document support
3. Implement search analytics
4. Add document versioning
5. Enhance error reporting dashboard
