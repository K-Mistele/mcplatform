# Namespace Management Sub-Feature

## Overview
This sub-feature handles the core CRUD operations for documentation namespaces - creating, viewing, editing, and deleting namespaces through the dashboard interface.

## Sub-Feature Scope
- Namespace listing page with status indicators
- Create/edit namespace modal with simplified configuration
- Namespace deletion with proper cleanup
- Integration with MCP server assignment (bidirectional many-to-many)

## Key Components
- **Main List View**: Table showing namespaces with status, document count, last updated
- **Create/Edit Modal**: Basic information form with GitHub Action integration focus
- **Assignment Interface**: Bidirectional MCP server relationship management

## Parent Feature Relationship
This is part of the larger Documentation Retrieval UI feature and depends on:
- Backend infrastructure (already complete)
- Database schema for namespaces (already exists)
- Integration with job monitoring for status display

## Related Sub-Features
- **Job Monitoring**: Provides status data for namespace display
- **Document Views**: Accessed from namespace detail pages
- **Search Testing**: Uses namespace selection as input

## Technical Notes
- Remove user configuration for embedding models/dimensions (display as disabled)
- Focus on GitHub Action integration rather than direct repository connection
- Follow existing MCPlatform patterns for async server components

## Implementation Priority
**High Priority** - This is the foundational sub-feature that enables all others.
