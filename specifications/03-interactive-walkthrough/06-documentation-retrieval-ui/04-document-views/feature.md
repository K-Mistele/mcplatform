# Document Views Sub-Feature

## Overview
This sub-feature provides browsable document content views, allowing customers to see their ingested documents and verify content quality through the dashboard interface.

## Sub-Feature Scope
- Document listing within namespaces
- Individual document content viewer
- Document metadata display (file path, chunks, processing status)
- Virtual scrolling for large document lists (1000+ documents)

## Key Components
- **Document List**: Table showing file paths, chunk count, status, last processed time
- **Document Viewer**: Full document content display with markdown rendering
- **Content Retrieval**: Server action → presigned S3 URL → client-side fetch pattern
- **Virtual Scrolling**: TanStack Virtual for performance with large document sets

## Parent Feature Relationship
This is part of the larger Documentation Retrieval UI feature and provides:
- Visibility into ingested document content for quality verification
- Access from namespace detail pages and search result links
- Integration with document processing pipeline

## Related Sub-Features
- **Namespace Management**: Accessed from namespace detail pages
- **Job Monitoring**: Shows which documents were processed in recent jobs
- **Search Testing**: Links to full documents from search result chunks

## Technical Notes
- Content retrieval: Server action generates presigned S3 URL, client fetches content
- Use TanStack Virtual for 1000+ document performance
- Markdown rendering for document content display
- Organization-scoped access control for document content

## Implementation Priority
**Medium Priority** - Enhances customer experience but not essential for core workflow.
