# Documentation Retrieval UI - Feature Definition Checklist

## Sub-Feature Status Tracking

### ‚úÖ Completed Sub-Features
- [ ] None yet

### üöß In Progress Sub-Features
- [ ] Creating unified parent feature specification

### üìã Planned Sub-Features

#### 01-namespace-management
- [x] Sub-feature directory created
- [x] High-level feature.md created
- [ ] Detailed feature specification created
- [ ] Technical unknowns resolved
- **Priority**: High - Foundation for all other features

#### 02-job-monitoring  
- [x] Sub-feature directory created
- [x] High-level feature.md created
- [ ] Detailed feature specification created
- [ ] Database schema additions planned (ingestion failures table)
- **Priority**: High - Critical feedback mechanism

#### 03-search-testing
- [x] Sub-feature directory created
- [x] High-level feature.md created
- [ ] Detailed feature specification created
- [ ] Integration with existing search backend planned
- **Priority**: Medium - Validation tool

#### 04-document-views
- [x] Sub-feature directory created
- [x] High-level feature.md created
- [ ] Detailed feature specification created
- [ ] Virtual scrolling implementation planned
- **Priority**: Medium - Quality assurance tool

## Technical Unknowns to Address

### üîç Research Required
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop folder upload**: Investigate web API support for folder drag/drop interface
- [ ] **Database schema additions**: Design ingestion failures table structure
- [ ] **Status calculation**: Implement derived status from processed/total documents using Drizzle generated columns
- [ ] **GitHub Action integration**: Design API endpoints for GitHub Action file upload workflow
- [ ] **Presigned S3 URLs**: Plan document content retrieval architecture
- [ ] **TanStack Virtual**: Integration patterns for large document lists

### üêõ Known Issues to Address
- [ ] **Critical MCP Tool Schema Bug**: Fix empty schema registration across all existing MCP tools
- [ ] **Status hardcoding**: Replace hardcoded job status with calculated values

## Implementation Dependencies

### Database Changes Required
- [ ] Add `mcp_server_documentation_namespaces` junction table
- [ ] Add `documentation_search_queries` analytics table  
- [ ] Add ingestion failures tracking table
- [ ] Update status calculation logic

### API Endpoints Required
- [ ] File upload API for GitHub Action integration
- [ ] Presigned URL generation for document content
- [ ] Real-time job status polling endpoints

### Integration Points
- [ ] MCP server assignment (bidirectional many-to-many like walkthroughs)
- [ ] Existing search backend from retrieval package
- [ ] Organization-scoped access control

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Create unified parent feature specification
2. Create detailed specifications for each sub-feature (priority order)
3. Address technical unknowns through research and prototyping
4. Plan database schema migrations
5. Begin implementation starting with namespace management
