# MCP Interactive Tool Patterns - Working Notes

## Key Patterns from Research

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern (Interactive Feedback MCP)
```typescript
// Tool Definition
{
  name: "interactive_feedback",
  description: "Provides step confirmation and user guidance",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      summary: { type: "string" },
      next_action: { type: "string" },
      requires_confirmation: { type: "boolean" }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Pattern
- Start with basic configuration
- Reveal advanced options based on user choices
- Use conditional tool registration based on user progress

### 3. Context Preservation Pattern
- Use Redis to maintain workflow state
- Pass session context between tool calls
- Enable resumable workflows across disconnections

## Implementation Ideas for MCPlatform

### Semantic Installer Wizard Tools

1. **Environment Detection Tool**
   - Detect user's development environment
   - Check prerequisites and dependencies
   - Return environment-specific installation steps

2. **Step Execution Tool**
   - Execute individual installation steps
   - Provide real-time progress feedback
   - Handle errors gracefully with recovery options

3. **Validation Tool**
   - Verify each step completed successfully
   - Test installed components
   - Generate next step recommendations

4. **Progress Tracking Tool**
   - Maintain walkthrough state
   - Enable resume from interrupted sessions
   - Provide completion analytics

### Integration with Existing Patterns

- Extend `OnboardingFlow` patterns to MCP tools
- Use existing OAuth flow for user identification
- Leverage session tracking for personalization
- Apply existing error handling patterns
