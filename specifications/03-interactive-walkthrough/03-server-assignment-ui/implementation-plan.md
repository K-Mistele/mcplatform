# Server Assignment UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implementation of the walkthrough assignment UI that allows customers to connect their centrally-managed walkthroughs to MCP servers. This feature provides a many-to-many relationship management interface with ordering and visibility controls, integrated into existing server detail pages and walkthrough management interfaces.

## Current State Analysis

The walkthrough authoring UI is complete, but assignment functionality is missing. Research revealed:
- No existing oRPC actions for managing the `mcpServerWalkthroughs` junction table
- The junction table schema exists but lacks `displayOrder` and `isEnabled` fields from requirements
- Server detail pages use card-based layouts, not tabs
- Multi-select component was recently added but not yet used
- Established patterns exist for drag-and-drop, organization scoping, and empty states

### Key Discoveries:
- Card-based grid layout at `/packages/dashboard/src/app/dashboard/mcp-servers/[serverId]/page.tsx:69`
- Junction table operations only in tests at `tests/03-interactive-walkthrough/01-core-infrastructure-mcp-tools/tool-registration.test.ts`
- Multi-select component ready at `/packages/dashboard/src/components/ui/multi-select.tsx:109`
- @dnd-kit patterns established in `StepsNavigator` component
- Empty state patterns consistent across dashboard

## What We're NOT Doing

- Converting server detail pages to tab-based layout
- Building a custom multi-select component (using existing one)
- Implementing bulk operations across multiple servers
- Creating walkthrough content or step management features
- Adding analytics or reporting capabilities
- Implementing assignment templates or conditional logic

## Implementation Approach

Backend-first strategy to ensure testability at each phase. We'll update the database schema, create comprehensive oRPC actions with tests, then build the UI components that consume these actions. This allows incremental development with full test coverage before any UI work begins.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates

### Overview
Add missing fields to the `mcpServerWalkthroughs` junction table to support display ordering and enable/disable functionality.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Database Schema Update
**File**: `packages/database/src/schema.ts`
**Changes**: Add displayOrder and isEnabled fields to mcpServerWalkthroughs table

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add `displayOrder` field as integer with default value 0
- Add `isEnabled` field as boolean with default value true
- Create compound unique constraint on (mcpServerId, walkthroughId) to prevent duplicates
- Add index on displayOrder for efficient ordering queries
- Update type exports to include new fields

#### 2. Database Migration
**File**: New migration file in `packages/database/migrations/`
**Changes**: Generate and apply migration for schema changes

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use Drizzle Kit to generate migration
- Set existing records' displayOrder based on creation order
- Set all existing records' isEnabled to true
- Test migration with existing data

### Success Criteria:

**Automated verification**
- [ ] `bun run db:generate` creates valid migration
- [ ] Migration applies successfully with `bun run db:migrate`
- [ ] Schema types updated in generated files

**Manual Verification**
- [ ] Existing junction records receive appropriate default values
- [ ] New fields appear in database schema
- [ ] No data loss during migration

## Phase 2: Backend oRPC Actions

### Overview
Create comprehensive oRPC actions for managing walkthrough-to-server assignments with proper organization scoping and validation.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Assignment Management Actions
**File**: `packages/dashboard/src/lib/orpc/actions.ts`
**Changes**: Add new server actions for assignment operations

**Implementation Requirements:**
- `assignWalkthroughsToServerAction`: Bulk assign walkthroughs to a server
  - Input: serverId, array of walkthroughIds with optional displayOrder
  - Clear existing assignments and create new ones
  - Validate server and walkthrough ownership
  - Maintain display order sequence
- `updateWalkthroughAssignmentAction`: Update single assignment properties
  - Input: serverId, walkthroughId, optional displayOrder/isEnabled
  - Validate assignment exists and user has access
  - Update specified fields only
- `removeWalkthroughAssignmentAction`: Remove single assignment
  - Input: serverId, walkthroughId
  - Validate ownership before deletion
  - Reorder remaining assignments
- `reorderServerWalkthroughsAction`: Bulk reorder assignments
  - Input: serverId, array of walkthroughIds in new order
  - Update all displayOrder values in single transaction
  - Validate all walkthroughs belong to server
- `getServerWalkthroughsAction`: Read assignments for a server
  - Input: serverId
  - Return walkthroughs with assignment properties
  - Order by displayOrder ascending

#### 2. Error Handling
**File**: `packages/dashboard/src/lib/orpc/router.ts`
**Changes**: Add new error types if needed

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use existing RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND for missing entities

- Add DUPLICATE_ASSIGNMENT if needed
- Consistent error messages

### Success Criteria:

**Automated verification**

- [x] Organization scoping properly enforced
- [x] No linter errors

**Manual Verification**

- Test success cases for all actions
- Test error cases (missing resources, cross-org access)
- Test bulk operations and edge cases

- Resource cleanup in afterEach

#### 2. Integration Tests
**File**: `packages/dashboard/tests/03-interactive-walkthrough/03-server-assignment-ui/integration.test.ts`
