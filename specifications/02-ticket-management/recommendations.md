# Support Ticket Management Improvement Recommendations

## Overview
Based on the research of the current support ticket system in MCPlatform, this document outlines comprehensive recommendations for improving the support ticket management user interface and functionality. The recommendations are organized into 5 phases to enable iterative development and early value delivery.

## Current State Analysis
The existing system provides basic functionality:
-  Ticket creation via MCP `get_support` tool
-  Dashboard viewing with filtering capabilities  
-  Basic ticket details display
-  Strong MCP server session associations
-  Organization-based multi-tenancy
- L Limited editing capabilities
- L No activity tracking or comments
- L No status management workflow
- L Linear/Slack integrations planned but not implemented

## Technical Foundation

### Rich Text Editor
We will use **shadcn-editor** (https://shadcn-editor.vercel.app/docs) for all markdown/rich text editing functionality. This Lexical-based editor provides:

- **Framework Integration**: Built for React with shadcn/ui components
- **Markdown Support**: Native markdown input and rendering capabilities
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Toolbar formatting, code blocks, image handling, mentions
- **Consistent UX**: Matches our existing shadcn/ui design system
- **Rich Functionality**: Autocomplete, emoji support, character counting, and more

This editor will be used for:
- Support ticket comments and responses
- Ticket description editing
- Template creation and editing
- Email composition (in later phases)

### Architecture Alignment
- **Server Components**: Fetch data in page-level async components
- **Client Components**: Use React 19 `use()` hook with Suspense boundaries  
- **oRPC Integration**: Follow existing patterns for actions and queries
- **Database Design**: Extend current schema with proper foreign key relationships
- **Security**: Maintain organization-level isolation and role-based access
