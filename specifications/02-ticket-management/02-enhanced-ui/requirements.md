# Phase 2 Requirements: Enhanced UI & User Experience

## Goal
Improve the overall user experience of support ticket management with better navigation, bulk operations, keyboard shortcuts, and advanced filtering capabilities.

## Important Context
Note: all paths provided in this document are relative to `packages/dashboard`, the dashboard package in this monorepo.
Exceptions: 
* All database-related paths such as `schema.ts`, `auth-schema.ts` and `mcp-auth-schema.ts` are under `packages/database/src`, and are exported under `packages/database/index.ts`
* Any paths beginning with `specification/` are at the top level of the repository and NOT under `packages/`; the `specification/` directory is at the SAME LEVEL as the `packages/` directory.

### Prerequisites
This phase builds upon Phase 1 (Core Support Ticket Management) and assumes the activity stream, status management, and basic editing functionality are already implemented.

## User Stories

1. **Bulk Operations**: When viewing the support tickets list, I want to select multiple tickets and perform bulk actions (status changes, assignments, bulk comments) to efficiently manage multiple tickets at once.

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: When managing tickets, I want to use keyboard shortcuts (e.g., 'c' for comment, 'a' for assign, 's' for status) to speed up common operations.

3. **Quick Actions Bar**: When viewing a ticket, I want a floating action bar with common operations easily accessible without scrolling.

4. **Advanced Search & Filters**: When browsing tickets, I want to search within ticket content, filter by multiple criteria, and save filter presets for quick access.

5. **Real-time Updates**: When other team members are viewing or editing the same ticket, I want to see live indicators and get notified of changes to avoid conflicts.

6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: When using mobile devices, I want a fully functional interface that adapts to smaller screens while maintaining usability.
