# Organization User Management Feature

## Overview
This feature enables organization administrators to fully manage their team members through a comprehensive user management interface. It provides the ability to invite users via magic links, manage user roles, and remove users from the organization, all through an intuitive dashboard interface.

## Business Value

### For MCPlatform Customers
- Streamlines team onboarding by allowing admins to easily invite and manage team members
- Provides visibility into organization membership and user roles
- Reduces friction in team collaboration by enabling self-service user management
- Improves security by allowing quick removal of users who no longer need access

### For End-Users
- Seamless onboarding experience through magic link invitations
- Clear understanding of their role and permissions within the organization
- Flexibility to join using their preferred authentication method (social login or password)

## Core Functionality

### User Invitation System
- Generate magic link invitations that can be shared via any communication channel
- Support for both email-based invitations and copyable links for Slack/Discord sharing
- Invitation links expire after 48 hours for security
- Ability to resend or cancel pending invitations
- Users can accept invitations and choose their preferred authentication method

### User Management Interface
- Comprehensive table view showing all organization members
- Display user details: name, email, role, status (active/invited), joined date
- Search and filter capabilities by name, email, or role
- Pagination support for organizations with many users
- Quick actions for editing roles and deleting users

### Role Management
- Support for organization roles: owner, admin, and member
- Organization admins and owners can manage all users in their organization
- Simple role assignment during invitation and editing
- Clear role-based permissions (admins can manage users, members cannot)

### User Deletion
- Hard deletion of users with confirmation dialog
- Immediate revocation of all active sessions upon deletion
- Only accessible to organization admins and owners

## User Stories

### Organization Administrators
- As an organization admin, I want to invite new team members via a shareable link so that I can quickly onboard them through our existing communication channels
- As an organization admin, I want to view all users in my organization so that I can understand who has access
- As an organization admin, I want to change user roles so that I can manage permissions as team responsibilities evolve
- As an organization admin, I want to remove users from my organization so that I can maintain security when team members leave

### Invited Users
- As an invited user, I want to join an organization through a magic link so that I can quickly get started without complex setup
- As an invited user, I want to choose my authentication method (social or password) so that I can use my preferred login approach

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- Number of invitations sent per organization
- Invitation acceptance rate
- Time from invitation sent to user activation
- Frequency of user management actions (role changes, deletions)

### Business Impact
- Reduction in support tickets related to user access and permissions
- Increased organization activation (organizations with >1 user)
- Improved customer satisfaction scores related to team management

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- Leverages better-auth's organization plugin for invitation functionality (see `/specifications/04-example-feature/resources/better_auth_organization_with_invite.md`)
- Uses better-auth's built-in invitation system with magic links
- Integrates with existing platform authentication (not sub-tenant MCP auth)
- Utilizes existing organization role system (owner, admin, member)

### User Experience
- New "Users" tab added to the sidebar navigation at the bottom
- Consistent with existing dashboard UI patterns using shadcn/ui components
- Mobile-responsive design for user management on all devices
- Clear visual feedback for all actions (invitations sent, users deleted, etc.)

### Dependencies
- Better-auth organization plugin (already implemented)
- Existing authentication system for platform users
- Email service for sending invitation emails (optional - links can be copied)

## Scope Boundaries

### Definitely In Scope
- User invitation via magic links
- Listing all users in an organization
- Changing user roles (owner, admin, member)
- Deleting users with confirmation
- Viewing and managing pending invitations
- Search and filter functionality
- Pagination for large user lists

### Definitely Out of Scope
- Audit trails or activity logs
- Tracking who invited whom
- User limits per organization
- Bulk user operations
- Custom roles beyond the existing three
- User profile editing beyond role changes
- Password generation or management by admins

### Future Considerations
- Bulk invitation functionality
- CSV import/export of users
- Activity logs and audit trails
- More granular permissions with RBAC
- Team-based user grouping
- User suspension (vs deletion)

## Open Questions & Risks

### Questions Needing Resolution
- Should we customize the invitation expiry time from the default 48 hours?
- Do we need any email template customization for invitations?
- Should there be any rate limiting on invitation sending?

### Identified Risks
- Potential for invitation link abuse if shared publicly
- Need to ensure proper permission checks to prevent unauthorized user management
- Session revocation must be immediate upon user deletion

## Next Steps
- Create detailed requirements document with specific UI mockups
- Define exact API endpoints needed beyond better-auth defaults
- Design the Users tab interface and navigation integration
- Plan database queries for efficient user listing with pagination
