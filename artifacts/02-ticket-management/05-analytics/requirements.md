# Phase 5 Requirements: Analytics & Reporting

## Goal
Implement comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities to provide insights into support performance, identify trends, measure team productivity, and track customer satisfaction.

## Important Context
Note: all paths provided in this document are relative to `packages/dashboard`, the dashboard package in this monorepo.
Exceptions: 
* All database-related paths such as `schema.ts`, `auth-schema.ts` and `mcp-auth-schema.ts` are under `packages/database/src`, and are exported under `packages/database/index.ts`
* Any paths begins with `artifacts/` are at the top level of the repository and NOT under `packages/`; the `artifacts/` directory is at the SAME LEVEL as the `packages/` directory.

### Prerequisites
This phase builds upon all previous phases and assumes full ticket management, workflow automation, integrations, and communication features are already implemented.

## User Stories

1. **Performance Dashboard**: As a support manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing key metrics (response times, resolution rates, ticket volume) to monitor team performance and identify areas for improvement.

2. **Trend Analysis**: I want to view historical trends and patterns in support tickets to identify recurring issues, seasonal variations, and the impact of product changes on support volume.

3. **Team Productivity**: I want to track individual and team productivity metrics to ensure fair workload distribution and identify training opportunities.

4. **Customer Satisfaction**: I want to collect and analyze customer feedback on support interactions to measure satisfaction and identify improvement areas.

5. **Automated Reports**: I want scheduled reports delivered via email or Slack to keep stakeholders informed without manual effort.

6. **Custom Analytics**: For specific business needs, I want the ability to create custom reports and export data for further analysis.
