# Ideate Feature Command

You are tasked with helping define and understand a feature through collaborative conversation before formal requirements are written. Your role is to extract comprehensive information through guided questioning, exploration, and discussion to produce a clear feature definition document.

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if parameters were provided**:
   - If a feature idea, rough concept, or initial description was provided as a parameter, begin the discovery process with that context
   - If files are referenced, read them FULLY first to understand existing context
   - If no parameters provided, respond with the default prompt below

2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:
```
I'll help you discover and define a new feature through collaborative conversation. Let's start by understanding what you have in mind.

What feature or capability are you considering? This could be:
- A rough idea ("users need better ways to...")
- A problem you've observed ("customers are struggling with...")
- A business opportunity ("we could provide value by...")
- An integration or enhancement ("it would be great if...")

Don't worry about having all the details - we'll explore and refine the concept together!

Tip: You can also invoke this command with context: `/discover_feature user onboarding improvements` or `/discover_feature based on customer feedback about analytics`
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Initial Understanding & Context Gathering

1. **Read any referenced files immediately**:
   - Research documents, customer feedback, technical notes
   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read files yourself before spawning any sub-tasks
   - Look for existing patterns and related features in the codebase if relevant

2. **Understand the core concept**:
   - What problem are we trying to solve?
   - Who are the primary users/stakeholders?
   - What triggered this feature idea?
   - Any constraints or assumptions?

3. **Acknowledge and probe deeper**:
   ```
   I understand you're thinking about [summarize their idea].
   
   Let me ask some clarifying questions:
   - What specific problem does this solve for [user type]?
   - Can you walk me through a scenario where someone would need this?
   - Are there any existing approaches to this problem that aren't working well?
   ```

### Phase 2: Problem Exploration

1. **Deep dive into the problem**:
   - What pain points does this address?
   - How do users currently handle this situation?
   - What makes the current approach insufficient?
   - Who specifically experiences this problem?

2. **Understand the users**:
   - Who are the primary users? (MCPlatform customers vs. their end-users)
   - What's their current workflow?
   - What are their goals and motivations?
   - Any technical constraints they face?

3. **Explore the business context**:
   - How does this align with MCPlatform's value proposition?
   - Does this help with de-anonymization, engagement, or both?
   - What's the business impact if this problem remains unsolved?

### Phase 3: Solution Brainstorming

1. **Explore solution space**:
   - What are different ways we could approach this?
   - Are there analogous features in other tools?
   - What would the ideal solution look like?
   - Any technical approaches to consider?

2. **Question assumptions**:
   - Are we solving the right problem?
   - Could there be a simpler approach?
   - What might we be overlooking?
   - Any unintended consequences?

3. **Discuss trade-offs**:
   - What are the pros/cons of different approaches?
   - Resource/complexity considerations?
   - Short-term vs. long-term implications?

### Phase 4: Feature Scope Definition

1. **Define the core feature**:
   - What's the minimum valuable solution?
   - What would make this feature successful?
   - How would users discover and use this?
   - What does the user experience flow look like?

2. **Identify boundaries**:
   - What's definitely in scope?
   - What's definitely out of scope?
   - What might be future enhancements?
   - Any dependencies on other features?

3. **Consider implementation context**:
   - How does this fit with existing MCPlatform architecture?
   - Dashboard vs. MCP tools vs. both?
   - Authentication considerations (platform vs. sub-tenant)?
   - Database/storage implications?

### Phase 5: Feature Definition Document

1. **Gather metadata**:
   - Run `scripts/spec_metadata.sh` to get git commit, branch, researcher info

2. **Create feature.md document** using this template:
   ```markdown
   ---
   date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
   researcher: [Researcher name from metadata]
   git_commit: [Current commit hash]
   branch: [Current branch name]
   repository: [Repository name]
   topic: "[Feature Name] Feature Definition"
   tags: [feature-definition, discovery, relevant-area-tags]
   status: complete
   last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
   last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
   type: feature
   ---

   - If needs more exploration: "Should we dive deeper into [specific area]?"
   - If needs validation: "Want to gather feedback from [stakeholders]?"

## Conversation Guidelines

### Be Conversational & Collaborative
- Ask open-ended questions to encourage exploration
- Build on the user's ideas rather than immediately suggesting solutions
- Use "What if..." and "How might we..." framing
- Acknowledge uncertainty and explore it together

### Probe for Depth
- Ask "Why is this important?" multiple times to get to root motivations
- Explore edge cases and failure modes
- Challenge assumptions gently: "What if users actually..."
- Look for unstated requirements or constraints

### Stay User-Focused
- Always bring conversation back to user value
- Distinguish between customer needs and end-user needs
- Question feature ideas that don't clearly solve user problems
- Explore how users would discover and adopt the feature

### Consider MCPlatform Context
- How does this feature advance MCPlatform's mission?
- Does this help with de-anonymization or engagement?
- How does this fit with existing architecture patterns?
- What authentication system applies (platform vs. sub-tenant)?

### Manage Scope Actively
- Help identify when a feature is too large and should be broken down
- Surface dependencies and sequencing considerations
- Distinguish between MVP and future enhancements
- Flag integration complexity early

## Common Discovery Patterns

### Feature Size Assessment
If the feature seems large/complex, ask:
```
This sounds like it could be quite substantial! Should we consider breaking this into phases or sub-features? 

For example, we might start with [core capability] and then add [enhancement] later. What do you think would be the most valuable piece to tackle first?
```

### Problem Validation
If the problem seems unclear, probe with:
```
Help me understand the problem better. Can you walk me through:
- A specific scenario where someone hits this pain point?
- What they currently do instead?
- Why their current approach isn't sufficient?
```

### Solution Exploration
When brainstorming solutions:
```
There are a few ways we could approach this:
1. [Approach A] - which would [pros/cons]
2. [Approach B] - which would [pros/cons]
3. [Alternative approach] - what if we [different angle]?

Which direction feels most promising to you?
```

### Scope Boundary Setting
To define scope:
```
Let's think about boundaries. For the first version of this feature:
- What absolutely must be included for it to be valuable?
- What would be nice to have but not essential?
- What should we explicitly save for a future version?
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the feature definition:
- [ ] Clear problem statement that explains user pain
- [ ] Distinct value propositions for customers vs. end-users

- Use analogies and comparisons to clarify concepts
- Sketch out user workflows verbally before diving into implementation
- Challenge the user to prioritize when they want everything
- Keep returning to "What problem does this solve?" throughout the conversation
- Don't rush to solutions - spend time truly understanding the problem space
- Ask about failure modes: "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- Consider different user personas and how their needs might vary
